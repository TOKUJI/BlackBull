# Changelog

All notable changes to BlackBull are recorded here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Versioning

BlackBull uses [ZeroVer](https://0ver.org/) prior to a 1.0 commitment:

- `0.MINOR.PATCH`
- `MINOR` advances at each sprint close (one minor per closed sprint).
  The number matches the sprint: `0.26.0` = Sprint 26 close.
- `PATCH` covers bug fixes / harness work between sprints.
- No `1.0.0` until the framework's identity (pure-Python H1 parser,
  BlackBull-internal `ASGIServer`, per-process tick scanner deadline
  subsystem) and public API have stabilised across several sprints.

The runtime version is exposed as `blackbull.__version__` via
`importlib.metadata.version("blackbull")` — single source of truth is
`pyproject.toml`.  Re-run `pip install -e .` after a local version bump
so the editable install's metadata catches up.

## [Unreleased]

(Nothing yet — next sprint pending.)

---

## [0.28.0] — 2026-05-31

**Sprint 28 — Early Alpha readiness.**  First release labelled
*Early Alpha*: the framework now has an externally-audited
readiness deliverable, a soak-tested leak-free posture, and an
EC2-reproducible benchmark cross-check against FastAPI.  API may
still break between MINOR versions per ZeroVer; see
[`docs/ALPHA_READINESS.md`](docs/ALPHA_READINESS.md) for the evidence map
and [`KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) for the
explicit "what's not promised yet" list.

### Added
- **`docs/ALPHA_READINESS.md`** — evidence-mapped readiness
  checklist (9 categories, ~36 items) with classification, top-3
  risks, top-5 missing validations.  Linked from `README.md` Early
  Alpha banner.
- **`KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`** — single consolidated doc covering
  RFC 8441 opt-in, HTTP/2 mux overhead, slowloris response shape,
  single-host benchmark caveats, RFC-defensible diffs from nginx
  in the differential corpus, no DB layer, no HTTP/3, no gRPC.
- **`bench/soak/`** — soak harness (1-hour wrk + tracemalloc +
  `/proc/<pid>/status` sampling, mixed-lane lua script).  Two
  1-hour soaks (single-worker + 4-worker) across 19.5 M requests
  confirmed RSS plateau, FD return-to-baseline, no growing
  tracemalloc slab.  Artefacts gitignored under
  `bench/results/soak/`.
- **`bench/aws/httparena_compare.sh`** — EC2 c7i.xlarge HttpArena
  comparison harness; provisions Docker + liburing 2.9 + gcannon
  from source + wrk + h2load + h2spec + Autobahn runner; vendors
  `bench/httparena/` as the framework; trap-EXIT teardown.
- **CLI `--version` flag** — prints `blackbull <version>` and
  exits 0.  Reads from `importlib.metadata.version('blackbull')`
  so it always agrees with the installed wheel.
- **HttpArena `/ws` echo route** + `/baseline2` (H/2 path) in
  `bench/httparena/app.py`.  Closes the WebSocket profile and the
  H/2 baseline; previously only H/1.1 was implemented.

### Changed
- **`StaticFiles` middleware now caches small files in memory.**
  mtime+size-keyed LRU cache (default ≤ 4 MiB per file, 256
  entries); cache hits are two `send()` calls with no thread-pool
  dispatch.  Replaces the per-request `asyncio.to_thread(...)`
  open/seek/read/close chain that exhausted the default
  ThreadPoolExecutor (8 workers) at HttpArena's c=1024–6800 load
  — first run plateaued at 71-79 r/s and subsequent runs collapsed
  to 0 r/s as the dispatch queue saturated.  Local back-to-back
  c=1024 measurements after the fix: 17,885 / 18,345 / 18,149 r/s
  with worker RSS flat at ~33 MB (was 275 → 768 MiB).  Files
  above the threshold keep the streaming path so per-request peak
  memory stays at one chunk regardless of body size.
- **Default error handler is environment-aware.**
  `_default_error_handler` (registered on every HTTP error status
  and `Exception`) now reads `BLACKBULL_ENV`:
  - `development` — surfaces the full Python traceback inline so
    users debugging locally see the failure point in the response
    body.  `Accept: text/html` returns a styled HTML page;
    everything else returns text/plain.
  - `production` — terse: status code + phrase only.  Exception
    class and message no longer leak to the network.
  Sets `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` explicitly on all
  error responses (previously omitted).
- **`bench/httparena/launcher.py` now spawns three workers** —
  HTTP cleartext on :8080, HTTPS+H1 on :8081, HTTPS+H2 on :8443.
  Matches HttpArena's `scripts/validate.sh` port layout
  (`PORT=8080`, `H1TLS_PORT=8081`, `H2PORT=8443`).  Closes the 5
  `json-tls` validation failures the previous two-process layout
  caused (nothing was bound on :8081).  Shape mirrors the
  HttpArena `frameworks/fastapi/launcher.py` reference — no
  port-readiness gating, no TLS-handshake synchronisation.

### Fixed
- **Static-file middleware run-2/run-3 collapse to 0 r/s** under
  HttpArena's high-concurrency wrk passes.  Root cause was
  asyncio thread-pool exhaustion (see "Changed" above), not a
  memory leak — RSS climbed because thousands of in-flight scope
  dicts and file descriptors accumulated while waiting on the
  shared executor.
- **`bench/peers/asgi_app.py`** + **`bench/app.py`** — replaced
  `status: 200 / 404` integer literals with `HTTPStatus.OK` /
  `HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND`.  Cosmetic; no runtime behaviour
  change.

### EC2 cross-check (Sprint 28 Task 3 + Task 4 carry-forward)
- HttpArena validate on `c7i.xlarge`: **49/49 pass** (previous
  pass-count 44/5 fail before the launcher fix).  Includes
  baseline H/1.1, pipelined, limited-conn, json, json-comp,
  json-tls, upload, static, baseline-h2, static-h2, echo-ws.
- HttpArena benchmark numbers captured for BlackBull and FastAPI
  across the validated profiles.  Detailed results in the
  Sprint 28 internal log; consolidated summary in
  `bench/CHARACTERIZATION.md ## Sprint history`.
- Static throughput on EC2 remained the dominant gap pre-cache;
  the in-memory cache lands as a 0.28.0 source change but the
  EC2 re-measure of static under the new code is a Sprint 29
  open carry-forward (no new EC2 spend in Sprint 28).

### Methodology
- **`docs/ALPHA_READINESS.md` classification flipped to
  "READY FOR EARLY ALPHA"** after Task 2 (soak) and Task 4
  (release-shape + EC2 cross-check) closed.  Both blocking risks
  noted at audit time — no ≥1-hour soak, no externally
  reproducible benchmark — are now closed.

---

## [0.27.1] — 2026-05-31

Packaging cleanup ahead of first PyPI publish.  Between-sprints PATCH
work per the ZeroVer rule — no `blackbull/` source changes outside
the new PEP 561 marker.

### Fixed
- **`beartype` promoted from `[validation]` optional extra to a hard
  dependency.**  `Router.validate()` imports `beartype.door` at every
  `app.run()` / `app.serve()` boot; with the prior packaging, a cold
  `pip install blackbull` followed by running any app crashed with
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'beartype'`.  The
  `[validation]` extra is retained as an empty no-op for
  backwards-compatible install commands.

### Packaging
- **Wheel slimmed from 243 → 67 files** (~590 KiB → ~209 KiB).  `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]`
  now `include = ["blackbull*"]` with explicit exclusions for `bench`,
  `tests`, `examples`, `docs`, `site`, `templates`.  Previously the
  wheel shipped benchmark snapshot directories and the full test
  suite, which `pip install blackbull` users had no reason to
  download.
- **PEP 561 typed distribution** — added `blackbull/py.typed` marker
  + `[tool.setuptools.package-data]` entry so downstream type-checkers
  (mypy, pyright) trust the inline annotations.
- **PyPI classifiers** — Development Status, Framework :: AsyncIO,
  License :: OSI Approved :: Apache Software License, Python 3.11 /
  3.12 / 3.13, HTTP Servers topic, Typing :: Typed.
- **Keywords** — `asgi asyncio http http2 websocket web framework
  server`.
- **`project.urls`** expanded — separate Documentation, Changelog,
  Issues entries (previously just two redundant pointers at the
  GitHub repo).

### Documentation
- **README rewritten** as a PyPI sell sheet — what BlackBull is, why
  someone would pick it, working install + hello-world + TLS +
  WebSocket + middleware snippets.  Internal P1/P2/P3/P4 roadmap
  removed (lived as project-facing todo, not user-facing reference).
- **Fixed a real bug in the prior README's hello-world.** Was
  `asyncio.run(app.run(port=8000))` — `app.run()` is itself a
  blocking sync entry point; wrapping it in `asyncio.run` raised on
  the first execution.  Now `app.run(port=8000)`, matching
  `examples/helloworld-simple.py`.

## [0.27.0] — 2026-05-30

Sprint 27 — methodology pin (cascade-multiplier rule) + HttpArena
local-only integration prep.  No optimisation Phase 2: the new
profile data placed the original Sprint 28 candidate (SSL/TLS Python
glue) under deployment-posture conditions and the `httptools` target
sub-cascade, both reclassified accordingly.

### Added
- **Cascade-multiplier rule** pinned in
  [`bench/CHARACTERIZATION.md ## Methodology`](bench/CHARACTERIZATION.md)
  as a sprint-gating mechanism.  Profile-share table maps per-call
  microbench delta → expected B-lane throughput delta.  Replaces the
  ad-hoc "≈2-3×" rule of thumb with three explicit bands
  (≥ 30 %, 10-30 %, < 10 %).
- **`bench/aws/profile_lanes.sh`** — wrk-driven per-lane py-spy
  capture on EC2 split topology.  `BB_TLS=0` opt-in for cleartext
  profiling (mirrors nginx-fronted production posture).  Lessons
  baked in: `(...&)` subshell form for nohup re-parenting, cold-cache
  warmup discard before the measured wrk pass.
- **`bench/app.py --no-tls`** flag — listens cleartext for the
  TLS-off profiling lane.
- **`bench/httparena/`** scaffold (Task 4) — HttpArena
  `frameworks/blackbull/`-shaped Docker container with two-process
  launcher (cleartext :8080, TLS :8081), `meta.json` declaring 13
  profiles, integration with the existing `Compression` +
  `StaticFiles` middleware.  Verified per-process 1.5-7.2× faster
  than FastAPI/uvicorn on H/1.1 + static paths; HTTP/2 served (vs
  uvicorn's zero h2c).  Not enabled for leaderboard submission.

### Fixed
- **HTTP/2 query-string scope (`scope['path']`)** — the H/2 `:path`
  pseudo-header was copied verbatim into `scope['path']` including
  any `?query`, and `scope['query_string']` was set to `str` where
  ASGI requires `bytes`.  Router pattern `/json/{count:int}` then
  failed to match `/json/3?m=2.0` and returned 404.  Centralised the
  split into a `_split_h2_path()` helper called from `parse_headers`
  (http + RFC 8441 websocket branches), `Stream.update_scope`, and
  the push-promise scope builder in `http2_actor.py`.  HTTP/1.1 was
  unaffected (its parser already partitions path + query at
  request-line decode time).
- **`Compression` middleware Content-Length** — when the upstream
  handler sets `Content-Length` on the uncompressed body (e.g.
  `StaticFiles`), the middleware previously left the original value
  in place after compressing.  Broke HTTP/1.1 keepalive framing and
  triggered protocol errors on strict HTTP/2 clients.  Now strips
  upstream `Content-Length` and writes the post-compression length.

### Methodology
- Sprint 28 anchor flipped from `httptools` to **deployment-posture
  dependent**.  Re-profile (`0c80080`, B1/B3 EC2 c7i.xlarge, py-spy
  200 Hz) showed:
  - With BlackBull terminating TLS: SSL/TLS Python glue ~15 %
    self-time → cascade-rule prediction +7-8 % B1 if coalesced.
  - With TLS terminated upstream (`--no-tls`, nginx-fronted
    posture): SSL/TLS slice **disappears** — no single Python slice
    exceeds ~5 % self-time post-Sprint-26.
  - `_parse` (the `httptools` target) was ~2 % self-time in both
    topologies — sub-cascade per the new rule.  Decommissioned as a
    Sprint 28 candidate; pure-Python H1 parser kept as identity.
- HTTP/3 / QUIC confirmed as **intentionally out of scope** —
  removed from Sprint 28 candidates.

## [0.26.0] — 2026-05-30

Sprint 26 — deadline subsystem rework.

### Changed
- **Per-arm `loop.call_later` replaced by a per-process tick scanner.**
  Singleton `TimerHandle` re-arms itself every `BB_DEADLINE_TICK_MS`
  (default 300 ms); `ConnectionDeadline.arm` / `disarm` become
  attribute writes + set ops.  Per-call cost: 1.69 µs → 350 ns
  (−79.3 % on Phase A, −83.7 % cumulative vs the Sprint 23
  `@contextmanager` baseline).  uvloop sanity: 332 ns/call.
- **`ConnectionDeadline.guard()` is now class-based.**  Replaced the
  `@contextmanager` decorator with `__enter__` / `__exit__` on the
  deadline instance directly; saves the per-call generator-frame
  allocation.  All five exit-path semantic cases (normal, non-CE
  raise, foreign CE, deadline CE, same-tick race) preserved
  byte-equivalent.
- EC2 c7i.xlarge sequential cross-pair (N=2) vs Sprint 25 close:
  B1 +17.4 % / +14.2 % (BB_UVLOOP=0/1), B2 +17.1 % / +19.1 %,
  B3 +18.3 % / +14.5 %.  7/7 B-lanes ✓.

### Added
- `bench/aws/full_ab_sequential.sh` — sequential N-pair wrapper for
  AWS accounts under the 32-vCPU default limit (parallel M=3 with
  c7i.xlarge + c7i.2xlarge needs 36 vCPU).  Methodologically
  equal-or-better than parallel M=N: sequential pairs sample
  different time windows, so neighbour drift becomes part of the
  cross-pair signal.
- `BASE_REF=<commit>` env mode in `bench/aws/full_ab.sh` — compare
  HEAD bytes vs an arbitrary historical commit for cumulative
  cross-sprint re-measures.

### Fixed
- `bench/aws/install.sh` — apt source swapped from
  `us-east-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com` to `archive.ubuntu.com` after
  the regional EC2 mirror was observed serving a 14-hour-stale
  `noble-updates/universe/binary-amd64/Packages.xz`.  Tolerate-on-
  failure retained as belt-and-braces.
- `full_ab.sh` — provisioning warnings now log exit code + tail of
  failing log into `orchestrator.log`; `up.sh` retries once after
  partial-state teardown.
- `_pair_bench.sh` — uvicorn bookend now pins `--loop uvloop`
  explicitly (was silently auto-detected; pair.log label
  `kind=uvicorn, uvloop=0` was misleading).

---

## [0.25.0] — 2026-05-29

Sprint 25 — HTTP/1 parser hot-path + cross-pair EC2 harness.

### Changed
- **`_parse` URL splitter** — `urllib.parse.urlparse` + `re.sub` →
  three `bytes.partition` calls + slice.  Per-call −91.6 %.
- **Header-loop regex validators** — per-byte `any(...)` validation
  scans → compiled-regex `search()` (`_FIELD_NAME_INVALID_RE`,
  `_FIELD_VALUE_INVALID_RE`).  Per-call −77.1 %.
- EC2 c7i.xlarge `TOPO=split` M=3 cross-pair: B1 +13.6 % / +15.3 %
  (BB_UVLOOP=0/1), 6/7 lanes ✓ (B7 △).  Measured 2-3× the
  microbench prediction at c=256 — the cascade-effect calibration
  is the load-bearing methodology lesson (later refined in 0.26.0
  + 0.27.0).

### Added
- `bench/aws/full_ab.sh` + `bench/aws/_pair_bench.sh` +
  `bench/aws/_aggregate_ab.py` — multi-pair cross-instance harness
  with uvicorn bookends (host-drift detection), identity check
  (`_assert_server_kind`), mpstat / vmstat capture, trap-cleanup.
- Per-sprint findings + raw numbers split out to
  `bench/sprint-logs/` (gitignored — protects external-server
  numbers from being cited as competitive benchmarks).
  `bench/CHARACTERIZATION.md` trimmed to current-state only.

---

## [0.24.0] — 2026-05-28

Sprint 24 — external-audit follow-ups + Lane E.

### Changed
- Methodology hardening: `RUNS_WRK=3` with MAD noise column + 🌫
  flag; `DURATION` default 30 → 60 s; `WARMUP=15` to settle
  allocator + TCP autotune + TLS session cache.
- Single-worker baseline-of-record refreshed against the new
  warmup + duration defaults.
- HPACK fastpath extended to request-side pseudo-headers
  (PUSH_PROMISE path).

### Added
- Lane E — connection churn (`Connection: close` per request),
  opt-in via `LANES="E-wrk"`.  Exposes accept-loop + TLS-handshake
  cost that the keep-alive-dominated Lane B hides.
- `/etc/sysctl.d/99-blackbull-bench.conf` installed by
  `bench/aws/install.sh` (`tcp_tw_reuse=1` + widened
  `ip_local_port_range`) to lift Lane E off the default
  accept-queue / port-range floor.
- Top-of-file cross-topology warning box in
  `bench/CHARACTERIZATION.md`; per-sprint status badges; "Audit
  recommendations already in place" defensive cross-ref.

---

## [0.23.0] — 2026-05-25

Sprint 23 — `asyncio.timeouts.*` cost removed from the per-request
hot path.

### Changed
- Replaced per-phase `async with asyncio.timeout(d):` context
  managers in `connection_actor.py` (sniff + preface),
  `http1_actor.py` (header + keep-alive idle), and `recipient.py`
  (per-chunk body) with a single rescheduled `loop.call_later()`
  `TimerHandle` per connection.
- AWS single-worker on c7i.xlarge `TOPO=split`: B1 plaintext
  **+6.5 %** (14 822 → 15 793 req/s).  py-spy at 200 Hz showed
  `asyncio.timeouts.*` at **0 samples** (was 9.6 % inclusive in
  Sprint 21 Phase B).

### Added
- `blackbull/server/deadline.py::ConnectionDeadline` with `guard()`
  contextmanager (Phase A surface; later replaced by class-based
  `__enter__`/`__exit__` in 0.26.0).

---

## [0.22.0] — 2026-05-23

Sprint 22 — framework / server separation.

### Changed
- `Headers` + `HeaderList` moved from `blackbull/server/` to
  top-level `blackbull/headers.py`.
- `ASGIEvent` folded into `blackbull/asgi.py`.
- `import blackbull` no longer transitively loads the server
  stack — use `from blackbull.server import ASGIServer` when
  embedding the server.

### Removed
- `BlackBull.{serve, create_server, has_server, wait_for_port,
  stop, port}` — embedded-server lifecycle is no longer part of
  the public API.  Callers wanting async lifecycle use
  `ASGIServer` from `blackbull.server` directly.
- `BlackBull.run()` is now synchronous (was async).

---

## Pre-0.22 — Phase 6 actor-model refactor

### Added

- **Level B event API** — `@app.on(event)` for fire-and-forget observation and
  `@app.intercept(event)` for synchronous interception with `call_next` chaining.
  Nine built-in events: `app_startup`, `app_shutdown`, `request_received`,
  `before_handler`, `after_handler`, `request_completed`, `request_disconnected`,
  `error`, `websocket_connected`, `websocket_message`, `websocket_disconnected`.
- **`asgi.py`** — `ResponseStart` / `ResponseBody` dict subclasses and
  `parse_response_event()` for typed ASGI send-event dispatch.
- **Observer task lifecycle** — in-flight `@app.on` tasks are tracked and drained
  at shutdown with a configurable timeout (`observer_shutdown_timeout`).
- WebSocket connection identity: `scope['_connection_id']` set to `uuid4` on connect.

### Changed

- **Middleware re-implemented as intercept sugar.** `app.use(mw)`,
  `middlewares=[...]` on routes/groups, `@app.on_startup`, `@app.on_shutdown`,
  and `@app.on_error(status)` all lower to `@app.intercept('...')` registrations.
  There is now a single runtime path; the old middleware chain is removed.
- **`StreamingAwareMiddleware` ABC removed.** Streaming is handled transparently
  by `HTTP1Sender`; middleware authors no longer need to subclass it.
- All built-in middleware (`compress`, `websocket`, `StaticFiles`) re-implemented
  as intercept hook registrations.
- Examples (`SimpleTaskManager`, `ChatServer`, `LoggingExample`, `PriorityExample`)
  rewritten to use the event API.

### Added (Phase 6 — Actor model)

- `blackbull/actor.py` — `Message` dataclass base and `Actor` base class with
  queue-based inbox (`asyncio.Queue`).
- `blackbull/event_aggregator.py` — `EventAggregator` bridges Level A Actor messages
  to Level B `EventDispatcher` calls. Framework-internal; not exported from
  `blackbull/__init__.py`.
- `blackbull/server/http1_actor.py` — `HTTP1Actor` (keep-alive loop per connection)
  and `RequestActor` (single request lifetime). Transport metadata (`peername`,
  `sockname`, `ssl`) injected as explicit keyword args — no `asyncio.StreamWriter`
  dependency.
- `blackbull/server/http2_actor.py` — `HTTP2Actor` (connection state machine) and
  `StreamActor` (per-stream ASGI dispatch). Runs stream tasks in `asyncio.TaskGroup`
  so all streams complete before the connection closes.
- `blackbull/server/websocket_actor.py` — `WebSocketActor` drives the WebSocket
  lifecycle after the HTTP upgrade.
- `blackbull/server/connection_actor.py` — `ConnectionActor` accepts TCP connections
  and dispatches to the correct protocol actor.
- `blackbull/client/` — async client package: `HTTP1Client`, `HTTP2Client`,
  `WebSocketClient`, and `Client` (ALPN-dispatching front door).

### Changed (Phase 6)

- `HTTP11Handler`, `HTTP2Handler`, `WebSocketHandler` deleted; Actors are the sole
  runtime path.
- `AbstractReader` / `AbstractWriter` used throughout — no implicit
  `asyncio.StreamWriter` dependency anywhere.
- Test suite reorganised into `tests/unit/` (parsing, framing, data structures),
  `tests/architecture/` (actor + event contracts), and `tests/conformance/http1/`
  and `tests/conformance/http2/` (full round-trip tests against a real `ASGIServer`).

### Fixed

- `parse_cookies()` now collects all `Cookie` headers. Firefox sends separate
  headers per cookie over HTTP/2; the previous code discarded all but the first.
