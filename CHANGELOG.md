## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Level B event API** — `@app.on(event)` for fire-and-forget observation and
  `@app.intercept(event)` for synchronous interception with `call_next` chaining.
  Nine built-in events: `app_startup`, `app_shutdown`, `request_received`,
  `before_handler`, `after_handler`, `request_completed`, `request_disconnected`,
  `error`, `websocket_connected`, `websocket_message`, `websocket_disconnected`.
- **`asgi.py`** — `ResponseStart` / `ResponseBody` dict subclasses and
  `parse_response_event()` for typed ASGI send-event dispatch.
- **Observer task lifecycle** — in-flight `@app.on` tasks are tracked and drained
  at shutdown with a configurable timeout (`observer_shutdown_timeout`).
- WebSocket connection identity: `scope['_connection_id']` set to `uuid4` on connect.

### Changed

- **Middleware re-implemented as intercept sugar.** `app.use(mw)`,
  `middlewares=[...]` on routes/groups, `@app.on_startup`, `@app.on_shutdown`,
  and `@app.on_error(status)` all lower to `@app.intercept('...')` registrations.
  There is now a single runtime path; the old middleware chain is removed.
- **`StreamingAwareMiddleware` ABC removed.** Streaming is handled transparently
  by `HTTP1Sender`; middleware authors no longer need to subclass it.
- All built-in middleware (`compress`, `websocket`, `StaticFiles`) re-implemented
  as intercept hook registrations.
- Examples (`SimpleTaskManager`, `ChatServer`, `LoggingExample`, `PriorityExample`)
  rewritten to use the event API.
