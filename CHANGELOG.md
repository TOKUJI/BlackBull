## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Level B event API** — `@app.on(event)` for fire-and-forget observation and
  `@app.intercept(event)` for synchronous interception with `call_next` chaining.
  Nine built-in events: `app_startup`, `app_shutdown`, `request_received`,
  `before_handler`, `after_handler`, `request_completed`, `request_disconnected`,
  `error`, `websocket_connected`, `websocket_message`, `websocket_disconnected`.
- **`asgi.py`** — `ResponseStart` / `ResponseBody` dict subclasses and
  `parse_response_event()` for typed ASGI send-event dispatch.
- **Observer task lifecycle** — in-flight `@app.on` tasks are tracked and drained
  at shutdown with a configurable timeout (`observer_shutdown_timeout`).
- WebSocket connection identity: `scope['_connection_id']` set to `uuid4` on connect.

### Changed

- **Middleware re-implemented as intercept sugar.** `app.use(mw)`,
  `middlewares=[...]` on routes/groups, `@app.on_startup`, `@app.on_shutdown`,
  and `@app.on_error(status)` all lower to `@app.intercept('...')` registrations.
  There is now a single runtime path; the old middleware chain is removed.
- **`StreamingAwareMiddleware` ABC removed.** Streaming is handled transparently
  by `HTTP1Sender`; middleware authors no longer need to subclass it.
- All built-in middleware (`compress`, `websocket`, `StaticFiles`) re-implemented
  as intercept hook registrations.
- Examples (`SimpleTaskManager`, `ChatServer`, `LoggingExample`, `PriorityExample`)
  rewritten to use the event API.

### Added (Phase 6 — Actor model)

- `blackbull/actor.py` — `Message` dataclass base and `Actor` base class with
  queue-based inbox (`asyncio.Queue`).
- `blackbull/event_aggregator.py` — `EventAggregator` bridges Level A Actor messages
  to Level B `EventDispatcher` calls. Framework-internal; not exported from
  `blackbull/__init__.py`.
- `blackbull/server/http1_actor.py` — `HTTP1Actor` (keep-alive loop per connection)
  and `RequestActor` (single request lifetime). Transport metadata (`peername`,
  `sockname`, `ssl`) injected as explicit keyword args — no `asyncio.StreamWriter`
  dependency.
- `blackbull/server/http2_actor.py` — `HTTP2Actor` (connection state machine) and
  `StreamActor` (per-stream ASGI dispatch). Runs stream tasks in `asyncio.TaskGroup`
  so all streams complete before the connection closes.
- `blackbull/server/websocket_actor.py` — `WebSocketActor` drives the WebSocket
  lifecycle after the HTTP upgrade.
- `blackbull/server/connection_actor.py` — `ConnectionActor` accepts TCP connections
  and dispatches to the correct protocol actor.
- `blackbull/client/` — async client package: `HTTP1Client`, `HTTP2Client`,
  `WebSocketClient`, and `Client` (ALPN-dispatching front door).

### Changed (Phase 6)

- `HTTP11Handler`, `HTTP2Handler`, `WebSocketHandler` deleted; Actors are the sole
  runtime path.
- `AbstractReader` / `AbstractWriter` used throughout — no implicit
  `asyncio.StreamWriter` dependency anywhere.
- Test suite reorganised into `tests/unit/` (parsing, framing, data structures),
  `tests/architecture/` (actor + event contracts), and `tests/conformance/http1/`
  and `tests/conformance/http2/` (full round-trip tests against a real `ASGIServer`).

### Fixed

- `parse_cookies()` now collects all `Cookie` headers. Firefox sends separate
  headers per cookie over HTTP/2; the previous code discarded all but the first.
