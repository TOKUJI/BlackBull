# BlackBull on HttpArena

BlackBull's framework integration for the
[HttpArena](https://www.http-arena.com/) benchmark harness.  The
directory is structured so it can be vendored under
[`MDA2AV/HttpArena`](https://github.com/MDA2AV/HttpArena) at
`frameworks/blackbull/` without further modification.

## Layout

```
bench/httparena/
  Dockerfile         multi-stage-free image; build context = repo root
  .dockerignore      keeps the image small
  app.py             BlackBull entrypoint with the HttpArena endpoint contract
  launcher.py        spawns cleartext (:8080) + TLS (:8081) processes
  meta.json          HttpArena framework metadata
  README.md          this file
```

## Profiles implemented

The endpoint contract in `app.py` covers the H1 / H2 / WebSocket
profiles BlackBull's runtime supports today:

| Profile         | Endpoint               | Status |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------|
| baseline        | GET/POST `/baseline11` | ✓ |
| pipelined       | GET/POST `/baseline11` | ✓ (same endpoint, pipeline-driven workload) |
| limited-conn    | GET/POST `/baseline11` | ✓ |
| json            | GET `/json/{count}`    | ✓ |
| json-tls        | GET `/json/{count}` on :8081 | ✓ |
| upload          | POST `/upload`         | ✓ |
| baseline-h2     | GET/POST `/baseline11` on :8443 (TLS, ALPN h2) | ✓ (claimed in `meta.json`) |
| baseline-h2c    | GET `/baseline11`  on :8082 (h2 prior-knowledge) | runtime-capable; not claimed in `meta.json` yet |
| json-h2c        | GET `/json/{count}` on :8082 (h2 prior-knowledge) | runtime-capable; not claimed in `meta.json` yet |
| echo-ws         | GET `/ws` upgrade      | ✓ (re-exported via the standard BlackBull WS handler — TODO mount at `/ws` here) |

A dedicated `:8082` cleartext listener is opened so HttpArena's
`validate.sh` port-open probe succeeds.  BlackBull's preface
auto-detect dispatches h2c connections through the HTTP/2 actor on
the same app/workers as `:8080`; the port stays idle during
benchmark runs that do not exercise h2c.  `baseline-h2c` /
`json-h2c` are runtime-capable on `:8082` but currently unclaimed in
`meta.json`.

Full-stack profiles implemented (v0.46.0+ — gRPC and the Postgres/Redis
profiles):

| Profile | Endpoint(s) | Backing |
|---|---|---|
| `async-db` | `GET /async-db?min&max&limit` | asyncpg pool (size = `DATABASE_MAX_CONN`), price-range `SELECT`; empty result when the DB is unavailable |
| `crud` | `GET/POST /crud/items`, `GET/PUT /crud/items/{id}` | asyncpg + Redis cache (get-by-id cached, update invalidates) |
| `api-4`, `api-16` | `/baseline11` (+ json / async-db) | load-generator CPU-budget profiles — no dedicated endpoint |
| `unary-grpc`, `unary-grpc-tls` | `benchmark.BenchmarkService/GetSum` | BlackBull gRPC bridge (`app.enable_grpc`); hand-rolled `SumRequest`/`SumReply` codec, no protobuf dep |

The `async-db` / `crud` profiles connect to the seeded Postgres (and Redis)
sidecars the HttpArena harness starts; connection details come from
`DATABASE_URL` / `REDIS_URL` / `DATABASE_MAX_CONN` (see `db.py`).  With no DB
configured the read paths return empty results rather than erroring, so the
container still boots for the protocol-only profiles.

Profiles **not** implemented (intentional carve-out):

| Profile | Why not |
|---|---|
| `static-h3`, `*-h3` | HTTP/3 / QUIC transport is intentionally out-of-scope per the project roadmap. |
| `StreamSum` (gRPC server-streaming) | BlackBull serves unary gRPC only this release; streaming is a follow-up. |
| `fortunes`, `gateway-*`, `production-stack` | Templated/aggregation/sidecar workloads beyond the current harness scope. |

## Local smoke test

The `_local/` subdir holds throwaway mounts that mirror what
HttpArena's harness provides; create it on first use.

```bash
mkdir -p bench/httparena/_local/data bench/httparena/_local/certs

# Dataset — pull HttpArena's authoritative 50-item file or use our own.
curl -fL -o bench/httparena/_local/data/dataset.json \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MDA2AV/HttpArena/master/data/dataset.json

# Reuse the project's mkcert dev cert as the TLS pair.
cp tests/cert.pem bench/httparena/_local/certs/server.crt
cp tests/key.pem  bench/httparena/_local/certs/server.key

# Build (context = this directory; BlackBull is pip-installed from PyPI).
docker build -t blackbull-httparena bench/httparena/

# Run with the documented mounts.
docker run --rm --network host \
  -v $PWD/bench/httparena/_local/data:/data:ro \
  -v $PWD/bench/httparena/_local/certs:/certs:ro \
  --name blackbull-httparena \
  blackbull-httparena

# In another terminal:
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/pipeline"                  # → ok
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/baseline11?a=1&b=2&c=3"     # → 6
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/json/3?m=2.0" | python3 -m json.tool
curl -sk "https://localhost:8081/baseline11?a=10"          # → 10
```

`_local/` is gitignored — local sandbox only.

## End-to-end HttpArena run

To actually drive the validation + benchmark scripts:

```bash
# One-time: clone HttpArena somewhere outside the BlackBull repo.
git clone https://github.com/MDA2AV/HttpArena.git ~/work/HttpArena

# Vendor this directory under HttpArena's frameworks/ tree:
mkdir -p ~/work/HttpArena/frameworks/blackbull
cp -r bench/httparena/* ~/work/HttpArena/frameworks/blackbull/

# Flip enabled=true in the vendored meta.json, then:
cd ~/work/HttpArena
./scripts/validate.sh blackbull           # 18-point correctness check
./scripts/benchmark.sh blackbull baseline # one profile
```

## Versioning + apples-to-apples

The Dockerfile pins `blackbull[compression]` to an explicit PyPI
version (currently `0.33.0`).  Bump the pin in lockstep with the
upstream release whose behaviour you intend the container to
exercise.

`BB_ACCESS_LOG=0` is set by `app.py` to match the peer benchmark
convention — every peer in the HttpArena framework set disables
access logging during benchmark runs.
